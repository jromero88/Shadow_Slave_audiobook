S2 Station lobby — Are you lost, boy?

S4 Armored holding room — Minutes later, Sunny was restrained in a vault room with armored walls. Officers watched with rifles as a gray-haired policeman entered.

S2 Creature reveal — A massive lump fell between caravan and wall, then rose — a towering monstrosity with fur like dirty snow, bone claws, and five milky eyes.
S3 First strike — The monster slashed. Sunny leapt aside, dragging the broad-shouldered slave into its path.
S4 Corpse transforms — The broad-shouldered corpse convulsed — bone spikes tearing skin, mouth splitting into rows of needle fangs.

S4 Allies freed — Ah! Free at last! Gods must be smiling upon us!
S5 Debate — The third larva died under the soldier’s blade. Shifty and Scholar argued over fleeing.
S6 Sunny’s choice — Sunny knew Scholar was right. The mountain itself was deadlier than hunger or chains.
