Rocks and shards of ice rained down. Slaves panicked, tangled in chains, screams filling the night.
A massive lump fell between caravan and wall, then rose — a towering monstrosity with fur like dirty snow, bone claws, and five milky eyes.
The monster slashed. Sunny leapt aside, dragging the broad-shouldered slave into its path.
Blood drenched him. A chilling howl shook the platform.
The broad-shouldered corpse convulsed — bone spikes tearing skin, mouth splitting into rows of needle fangs.
Sunny realized: this was no beast. It was a tyrant, creating a spawn of itself — far beyond a First Nightmare’s rules.
Sunny acted. He looped the chain around the monster’s shoulders, pulling to bind its arms.
The shifty slave and scholar pulled hard, tightening the chain as the monster strained.
Sunny wrapped the shackle chain around its neck, pulling with his whole body, back arched against it.
Sweat and blood covered him. Every muscle screamed. Finally, the monster went limp.
