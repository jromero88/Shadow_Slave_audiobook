Sunny dreamt of a jagged, lonesome mountain bathed in ghostly moonlight. Time reversed before his eyes: snow retreated, bones appeared, then a slave caravan moved backward down the slope.
A dull ache spread from Sunny’s bleeding feet. Shackles tore at his wrists, his thin tunic useless against the biting wind. Ahead, a broad-shouldered man walked steadily. Behind him, a shifty-eyed slave cursed under his breath.
Sunny tried to summon a status screen. Runes shimmered in the air, revealing his Aspect.
Name: Sunless. Rank: Aspirant. Aspect: Temple Slave. Aspect description: A temple slave is a useless wretch, rare but powerless.
A young soldier rode up on a white horse. Noble, dignified — and irritatingly pretty. His voice carried concern.
Before Sunny could drink, a whip cracked. Pain lanced his back as an older soldier glared at the youth.
Sunny watched the older soldier ride past with malice. Then he looked at the young soldier, head bowed.
