A frail-looking young man sat on a rusty bench across from the police station, cradling a cup of real, plant-based coffee he could barely afford.
Sunny had decided to pamper himself—after all, his life was coming to an end.
He raised the cup, savored the aroma, took a tentative sip… and grimaced.
He slapped himself to stay awake, cursed the purchase, then finished the coffee. Well-fed citizens rushed past, staring at his thin, pale figure.
With a slight grin, Sunny crossed the street and entered the police station.
The Nightmare Spell first appeared decades ago, as the world recovered from disaster and war. Fatigue became slumber, then death—and the dead became monsters.
The Awakened—those who survived their first trial—restored a fragile order. But for Sunny, poor and untrained, being chosen meant only death.
Minutes later, Sunny was restrained in a vault room with armored walls. Officers watched with rifles as a gray-haired policeman entered.
Sunny's eyelids grew heavy. He felt touched by the words, then slipped into darkness.
