A frail-looking young man sat on a rusty bench across from the police station, cradling a cup of real, plant-based coffee he could barely afford.
Sunny had decided to pamper himself—after all, his life was coming to an end.
He raised the cup, savored the aroma, took a tentative sip… and grimaced.
He slapped himself to stay awake, cursed the purchase, then finished the coffee. Well-fed citizens rushed past, staring at his thin, pale figure.
With a slight grin, Sunny crossed the street and entered the police station.
The Nightmare Spell first appeared decades ago, as the world recovered from disaster and war. Fatigue became slumber, then death—and the dead became monsters.
The Awakened—those who survived their first trial—restored a fragile order. But for Sunny, poor and untrained, being chosen meant only death.
Minutes later, Sunny was restrained in a vault room with armored walls. Officers watched with rifles as a gray-haired policeman entered.
Sunny's eyelids grew heavy. He felt touched by the words, then slipped into darkness.

=== 02_chapter2 ===
Sunny dreamt of a jagged, lonesome mountain bathed in ghostly moonlight. Time reversed before his eyes: snow retreated, bones appeared, then a slave caravan moved backward down the slope.
A dull ache spread from Sunny’s bleeding feet. Shackles tore at his wrists, his thin tunic useless against the biting wind. Ahead, a broad-shouldered man walked steadily. Behind him, a shifty-eyed slave cursed under his breath.
Sunny tried to summon a status screen. Runes shimmered in the air, revealing his Aspect.
Name: Sunless. Rank: Aspirant. Aspect: Temple Slave. Aspect description: A temple slave is a useless wretch, rare but powerless.
A young soldier rode up on a white horse. Noble, dignified — and irritatingly pretty. His voice carried concern.
Before Sunny could drink, a whip cracked. Pain lanced his back as an older soldier glared at the youth.
Sunny watched the older soldier ride past with malice. Then he looked at the young soldier, head bowed.

=== 03_chapter3 ===
Sunny tried to enjoy the pristine mountain air, cleaner than anything in the real world.
Slaves stumbled and fell. Those who could not walk were cut from the chain and thrown into the abyss.
Sunny reflected on how he had come to terms with death — carving his own name beneath his parents’ on an old tree.
He knew cold would not kill him; the bones he had seen in his vision foretold monsters yet to come.
Sunny summoned the runes again, this time reading his Attributes.
[Fated]: The strings of fate wrap tightly around you… unlikely events drawn by your presence.
[Mark of Divinity]: A faint scent of divinity lingers. [Child of Shadows]: Shadows recognize you as their own.
As night fell, Sunny realized he could see perfectly in darkness.
The slaves collapsed in a clearing. Soldiers built a bonfire and herded them into a circle.
Sunny received icy water and moldy bread, forcing it down with no relief from hunger.
The shifty slave crawled toward bright-red berries sprouting through snow.
Sunny recognized the camp as the site of slaughter from his vision.
As if in answer, a thunderous noise rang from above, and something massive crashed down from the sky.

=== 04_chapter4 ===
Rocks and shards of ice rained down. Slaves panicked, tangled in chains, screams filling the night.
A massive lump fell between caravan and wall, then rose — a towering monstrosity with fur like dirty snow, bone claws, and five milky eyes.
The monster slashed. Sunny leapt aside, dragging the broad-shouldered slave into its path.
Blood drenched him. A chilling howl shook the platform.
The broad-shouldered corpse convulsed — bone spikes tearing skin, mouth splitting into rows of needle fangs.
Sunny realized: this was no beast. It was a tyrant, creating a spawn of itself — far beyond a First Nightmare’s rules.
Sunny acted. He looped the chain around the monster’s shoulders, pulling to bind its arms.
The shifty slave and scholar pulled hard, tightening the chain as the monster strained.
Sunny wrapped the shackle chain around its neck, pulling with his whole body, back arched against it.
Sweat and blood covered him. Every muscle screamed. Finally, the monster went limp.

=== 05_chapter5 ===
Sunny fell to his knees, breathless, body broken yet exhilarated. No Memory appeared, only pain and cold.
The larva’s corpse still chained them. Shifty and Scholar untangled links while chaos raged further away.
Several maimed bodies began to move. Four more larvae rose, fangs glistening.
A larva lunged — but a sword flashed, beheading it in one strike.
The young soldier fought on, then threw something to Sunny.
It was a bent iron rod. A key to the shackles.
With a click, Sunny was free. He rubbed his wrists, eyes gleaming with dark intent.
The third larva died under the soldier’s blade. Shifty and Scholar argued over fleeing.
Sunny knew Scholar was right. The mountain itself was deadlier than hunger or chains.
