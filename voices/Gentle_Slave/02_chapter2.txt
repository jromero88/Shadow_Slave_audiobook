This mountain pass is usually warmer. We had bad luck. Also, I advise you against harming this boy.
Look at his markings. He was born a slave. A temple slave. The Imperials destroyed the last temple of the Shadow God. That is how he ended up here.
The Empire is guarded by the War God. We are not. Do you want to risk angering another god?
It's nothing, sir. We are tired and cold. Especially the young one. This journey is too hard for him.
