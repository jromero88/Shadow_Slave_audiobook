    <prosody rate="medium">This mountain pass is usually warmer. We had bad luck. Also, I advise you against harming this boy.</prosody>
    <prosody rate="medium">Look at his markings. He was born a slave. A temple slave. The Imperials destroyed the last temple of the Shadow God. That is how he ended up here.</prosody>
    <prosody rate="medium">The Empire is guarded by the War God. We are not. Do you want to risk angering another god?</prosody>
    <prosody rate="medium">It&#x27;s nothing, sir. We are tired and cold. Especially the young one. This journey is too hard for him.</prosody>
